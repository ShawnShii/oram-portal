GitHub Rules of Engagement

# Introduction

While your team is not meeting with your TA, this activity is to help structure some discussion that your team should have to help make things run more smoothly.

It is important to discuss the rules of engagement when using GitHub because it will setup the norms and expectations within your team of how you will use GitHub. They do not need to be the same rules as any other team, but having clear expectations of how the entire team interacts with the repo will reduce conflict or confusion in the future of what is going on in your team's repo.

You will be expected to submit the results of this discussion with your iteration part 1 either as part of that submission or a link to where it made the most sense to put for your team, so your team can readily find and consult it (Hint: You probably want to do the latter).
