ORAM (http://oramrefugee.org/) is an international non-profit organization dedicated to protecting the world's most vulnerable refugees. We seek to create a multi-language registration system allowing LGBTI refugees worldwide to enter information and upload documents on a secure platform that will save time and increase accuracy.
